# Red Raider Planner
All the documentation, graphs and whatnot for the second release are located in the graphsAndDocumentation folder

In order to run properly, all .java files must be in a package named planner
The main method is in RRPrunner.java
There are test events included if you want to test the viewWeek/viewCalendar functions
they are on the following days:
    1/29
    1/30
    2/1
    2/29
That said, the addevent functions also work.  Take care to not input invalid inputs, we don't have catches everywhere.
